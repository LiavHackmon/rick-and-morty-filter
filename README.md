# Rick and Morty Characters Filter Service

## Overview

This project queries the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest) to retrieve all characters that meet the following criteria:

- Species: **Human**
- Status: **Alive**
- Origin: **Earth**

The filtered data includes the following fields:

- Name
- Location
- Image URL

The results are written to a CSV file and exposed through a REST API service.

---

## Features

1. **API Data Retrieval**  
   Queries the Rick and Morty API and filters characters based on species, status, and origin.

2. **CSV Export**  
   Exports the filtered data into a CSV file (`rick_and_morty_characters.csv`) with columns:  
   `Name, Location, Image`

3. **REST API**  
   Provides a Flask-based REST API with the following endpoints:
   - `GET /characters` â€” Returns the filtered character data as JSON.
   - `GET /healthcheck` â€” Returns a simple status response to verify the service health.

4. **Dockerized Application**  
   Includes a Dockerfile to build and run the application inside a container for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Required Python packages (`requests`, `flask`, etc.)

Run the data retrieval script to generate the CSV file:
python rick_and_morty2.py

Start the Flask API server:
python app.py

Build the Docker image:
docker build -t rick-morty-app .

Run the container (mapping port 5000):
